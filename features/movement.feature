 Feature: Movement of cells from the same team

  Scenario: Move level 1 ice cell to an empty adjacent cell
    Given I have a level 1 ice cell at position (3, 3), with 15 health points
    And the adjacent cell at position (4, 3) is empty
    When I try to move the level 1 ice cell to position (4, 3)
    Then the ice cell moves successfully to position (4, 3)

  Scenario: Move level 1 fire cell to an empty adjacent cell
    Given I have a level 1 fire cell at position (3, 3), with 15 health points
    And the adjacent cell at position (4, 3) is empty
    When I try to move the level 1 fire cell to position (4, 3)
    Then the fire cell moves successfully to position (4, 3)

#   Scenario: Attempt to move level 1 ice cell to a cell occupied by another level 1 cell
#     Given I have a level 1 ice cell with life 19 at position (3, 3)
#     And another level 1 ice cell whit life 15 at position (4, 3)
#     When I try to move the level 1 ice cell to position (4, 3)
#     Then the cells merge, generating a new level 2 cell at position (4, 3)

  Scenario: Attempt to move level 1 ice cell to an adjacent cell occupied by a level 3 cell
    Given I have a level 1 ice cell with life 19 at position (3, 3)
    And another level 3 ice cell with life 45 at position (4, 3)
    When I try to move the level 1 ice cell to position (4, 3)
    Then both cells coexist in cell (4, 3)

  Scenario: Attempt to move level 1 fire cell to an adjacent cell occupied by a level 3 cell
    Given I have a level 1 fire cell with life 19 at position (3, 3)
    And another level 3 fire cell with life 41 at position (4, 3)
    When I try to move the level 1 fire cell to position (4, 3)
    Then both cells coexist in cell (4, 3)

  Scenario: Attempt to move level 2 ice cell to an adjacent cell occupied by a level 1 ice cell
    Given I have a level 2 ice cell with life 26 at position (3, 3)
    And a level 1 ice cell with life 9 at position (4, 3)
    When I try to move the level 2 ice cell to position (4, 3) with 25 health points
    Then both cells cannot merge, and coexist at position (4, 3)

  Scenario: Attempt to move level 2 fire cell to an adjacent cell occupied by a level 1 fire cell
    Given I have a level 2 fire cell with life 30 at position (3, 3)
    And a level 1 fire cell with life 2 at position (4, 3)
    When I try to move the level 2 fire cell to position (4, 3) with 29 health points
    Then both cells cannot merge, and coexist at position (4, 3)

#   Scenario: Move cell to a cell occupied by 2 cells of different levels same team (coexisting)
#     Given I have a level 1 fire cell at position (2, 2)
#     And a level 2 fire cell at position (2, 2)
#     And another level 1 fire cell at position (3, 2)
#     When I try to move the level 1 cell to position (2, 2)
#     Then the level 1 cells die, and the level 2 cell survives at position (2, 2)
